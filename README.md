# Password-Strength-Checker
A comprehensive Python-based password strength analyzer that evaluates password security and provides actionable feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.
ðŸ“‹ Features

Multi-Level Strength Analysis: Rates passwords from "Very Weak" to "Very Strong"
Length Validation: Checks password length and recommends 12+ characters
Character Variety Detection: Validates presence of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
Common Pattern Detection: Identifies weak patterns like "123", "password", "qwerty", etc.
Repetition Detection: Flags repeated characters (e.g., "aaa", "111")
Entropy Calculation: Measures password randomness in bits
Crack Time Estimation: Estimates time needed for brute force attacks
Color-Coded Feedback: Visual indicators for easy interpretation
Interactive Interface: Test multiple passwords in one session
No external dependencies required! Uses only Python standard library (re, math)
